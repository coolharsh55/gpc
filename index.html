        This document defines a signal, transmitted over HTTP and through the DOM, that conveys a
        person's request to websites and services to not sell or share their personal information with
        third parties. This standard is intended to work with existing and upcoming legal frameworks
        that render such requests enforceable.

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Building websites today often involves relying on services provided by businesses other than
        the one with which a person chooses to interact. This result is a consequence of the
        increasing complexity of Web technology and of the division of labor between different
        services. While this architecture can be used in the service of better Web experiences,
        T([[?privacy-principles]]). While data can be  document which provides definitions
        and explanations for the concepts used shared
        with service providers for limited operational purposes, it can also be shared or used in this specification.for
        behavioral targeting in ways that many users find objectionable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several different legal frameworks have been proposed or enacted by jurisdictions around
        the world to address this concern. Some models rely upon user consent for tracking. Other
        models based on the principle of data minimization simply prohibit certain data sharing or 
        data processing entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some laws and proposals grant users the right to request that their privacy be
        protected, including "opt out" requests that their data not be sold or shared beyond the
        business with which they intend to interact. Requiring that people manually express their
        T is, however, impractical, and an imposition of 
        "privacy labor" on people ([[?privacy-principles]]). document which provides definitions
        and explanations for the concepts used in this specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification is designed for this last category of laws and addresses the problem of the
        difficulty of scaling user choices by providing a way to universally signal to all website
        publishers, through an HTTP header
        or the DOM, a person's assertion of their applicable rights to prevent the sale of their data,
        the sharing of their data with third parties, and the use of their data for cross-context targeted
        advertising. This signal allows users to take advantage of specific provisions in some of these
        opt-out based laws, such as, for example, the provisions relating to "opt out preferences
        signals" in the California Consumer Privacy Act to stop the sale of sharing of personal information,
        [[?CCPA-REGULATIONS]], or similar provisions for "universal opt-out mechanisms" in laws in Colorado
        and other states to allow users to opt out of the sale of their information or its use for
        cross-organization targeted advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, while the Global Privacy Control is designed to allow users to express a preference to opt out
        of sharing and cross-context targeted advertising, the control is not intended to exercise every possible
        privacy right, nor even every right to opt out of advertising or ad targeting. GPC is not designed to
        exercise deletion rights, for example. GPC is also not designed to address [=same site=] data collection and
        [=same site=] ad targeting. For more details, see the
        <a href="https://w3c.github.io/gpc/explainer" target="_blank">Legal and Implementation Considerations Guide</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The specification should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the opt-out model of
        regulation — or of cross-context tracking more broadly — or a rejection of other models based on
        consent or data minimization. It is instead designed to make it possible to exercise the affirmative rights
        granted to users in certain jurisdictions.

      <h2>Definitions</h2>
        A <dfn>do-not-sell-or-share interaction</dfn> is an interaction with a website in which the
        person is requesting that their data not be sold to or shared with any party other than the
        one the person intends to interact with, or to have their data used for cross-context ad targeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <dfn data-lt="preference">do-not-sell-or-share preference</dfn> is when a person requests
        that their data "not be sold or shared" for instance by activating a Global Privacy Control
        setting with their user agent or by using tools that default to such a setting (possibly
        because this setting matches the most common expectations of that tool's users).
        When set, this [=preference=] indicates that the person expects to browse the Web with
        [=do-not-sell-or-share interactions=].

        The [[PRIVACY-PRINCIPLES]] document provides definitions
        and additional guidance for concepts used in this specification.
        The reader is advised to also refer to it when exploring
        and implementing this specification.

      <h2>Expressing a Do Not Sell Or Share Preference</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Expression Format</h3>
        <p>
          A Global Privacy Control [=preference=] should be conveyed for all HTTP requests (in the form
          of the HTTP header) and all websites (in the form of the Web API property).
        </p>
        <p>
          If set, this [=preference=] is expressed as a single value of <code>1</code> or equivalently
          <code>true</code> according to context.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the absence of regulatory, legal, or other requirements, websites MAY interpret an
          expressed Global Privacy Control [=preference=] as they find most appropriate for the given
          person, particularly as considered in light of the person's privacy expectations, context, and
          cultural circumstances. Likewise, websites might make use of other [=preference=] information
          outside the scope of this protocol, such as site-specific person [=preferences=] or third-party
          registration services, to inform or adjust their behavior when no explicit [=preference=] is
          expressed via this protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents are expected to convey a person's [=preferences=] as accurately as they can. User
          agents SHOULD strive to represent what the user agent best believes to be the person's
          [=preference=] for the Global Privacy Control value.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Preference Caching</h3>
        <p>
          The [=preference=] MUST be cached on each top-level navigation to ensure consistency in communication of
          the person's request that their data "not be sold or shared." This means that if the [=preference=] changes
          during or after a top-level navigation, it will not be reflected until the next navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A [=top-level browsing context=] has a <dfn><code>gpcAtNavigation</code></dfn> boolean.
          It is initially <code>false</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of [=gpcAtNavigation=] MUST reflect the [=preference=]
          of the person when the [=top-level browsing context=]'s [=navigable/active document=] began loading.
          It will be <code>true</code> if the person's  [=preference=] was enabled, and <code>false</code> if
          the person's [=preference=] was disabled or had not been set.
        </p>
        <p>
          If [=preference=] is changed to be inconsistent with some <code>gpcAtNavigation</code> cached in a
          [=top-level browsing context=], the user agent SHOULD inform the user of any inconsistent tabs and provide
          the option to reload them, refreshing the cached <code>gpcAtNavigation</code> to reflect the current [=preference=].
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The <code>Sec-GPC</code> Header Field for HTTP Requests</h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn><code>Sec-GPC</code></dfn> header field is a mechanism for expressing a person's
          general universal [=preference=] for a [=do-not-sell-or-share interaction=] in HTTP requests
          (for any request method). In some cases, a specific arrangement with that person may permit
          a website to ignore a generally applicable [=preference=] (see § 5.3 below and the
          <a href="https://w3c.github.io/gpc/explainer" target="_blank">Legal and Implementation
          Considerations Guide</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The syntax ([[ABNF]]) of the field is:
        </p>
        <pre class="hljs">
          Sec-GPC-field-name  = "Sec-GPC"
          Sec-GPC-field-value = "1"
        </pre>
        <p>
          A user agent MUST NOT generate a <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> header field if [=top-level browsing context=]'s
          <code>gpcAtNavigation</code> is <code>false</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent MUST generate a <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> header field with a field-value that
          is exactly the numeric character "1" if [=top-level browsing context=]'s
          <code>gpcAtNavigation</code> is <code>true</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent MUST NOT generate more than one <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> in a given HTTP
          request and MUST NOT use a <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> field in an HTTP trailer.
        </p>
        <p>
          A server processing an HTTP request that contains a <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> header MUST
          ignore it and process the request as if that header had not been specified unless the
          field value is exactly the character "1". If there are multiple <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code>
          headers and at least one has a field value of exactly "1" then the server MUST treat the
          request as if there were only one <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> header with a field value of
          "1"; and as if there were none otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTTP intermediaries MUST NOT remove a <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> header set to "1", but they
          MAY remove <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> headers that contain other values. Additionally, an
          HTTP intermediary that has reasons to believe the the person originating a given HTTP
          request has a [=do-not-sell-or-share preference=], MAY insert a <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code>
          header set to "1".
        </p>
        <aside class="example" title="Example GPC Request">
          <pre class="hljs http">
            GET /something/here HTTP/2

          <h4>
            Extensibility of the Sec-GPC Field Value
          </h4>
          <p>
            The <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> is deliberately defined without an extension mechanism.
            Experience with previous similar headers shows that people tend to rely on string
            equality instead of parsing the value when testing for their presence, especially when
            extensions do not yet exist. Such checks would of course fail in the presence of
            extension content, which would in turn render the mechanism moot. Should extensions
            prove necessary to this standard, they will need to be implemented through other
            headers, which may in time supersede this one.

        <h2>JavaScript Property to Detect Preference</h2>
        <p>
          The {{GlobalPrivacyControl/globalPrivacyControl}} property enables a client-side
          script to determine what <code>[=Sec-GPC=]</code> header field value was sent when
          loading the [=top-level browsing context=]'s [=navigable/active document=].
        </p>
        <pre class="idl">
          interface mixin GlobalPrivacyControl {
            readonly attribute boolean globalPrivacyControl;
          };
          Navigator includes GlobalPrivacyControl;
          WorkerNavigator includes GlobalPrivacyControl;
        </pre>
        <p>
          The value is <code>false</code> if no <code>Sec-GPC</code> header field would be sent;
          otherwise, the value is <code>true</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of {{GlobalPrivacyControl/globalPrivacyControl}} MUST be the
          [=top-level browsing context=]'s <code>gpcAtNavigation</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The {{GlobalPrivacyControl/globalPrivacyControl}} property is available on the
          <code>navigator</code> object in both regular and worker contexts, and so can be checked
          reading from <code>navigator.globalPrivacyControl</code>.

      <h2>GPC Support Resource</h2>
      <p>
        A site MAY produce a resource at a .well-known URL in order for a site to represent the fact
        that it abides by GPC requests, at least where required to do so. The purpose of a GPC support
        resource is for a site to convey its awareness of and support for the Global Privacy Control.
        The support resource is not intended to convey whether the site abides by GPC requests from
        the user agent accessing the resource. By default, an origin's support is <em>unknown</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A GPC support resource has the well-known identifier <code>/.well-known/gpc.json</code>
        relative to the origin server's URL [[RFC8615]].
      </p>
      <p>
        An origin server that receives a valid GET request targeting its GPC support resource
        responds either with a successful response containing a machine-readable representation of
        the site-wide tracking status, as defined below, or a sequence of redirects that leads to
        such a representation (which MAY be provided by a server at another origin).
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>GPC Support Representation</h2>
        <p>
          The origin server MUST return the GPC support resource as a valid representation using the
          <code>application/json</code> media type [[RFC8259]], otherwise the origin's support is
          unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GPC support representation MUST be a
          <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-4">JSON object</a>, otherwise the
          origin's support is unknown. Members of this JSON object not in the list below have no
          meaning in this specification and MUST be ignored. Members include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              A <code>gpc</code> member. The value of the <code>gpc</code> member MUST be either
              <code>true</code>, to indicate that the server intends to abide by GPC requests at least
              to the extent it is legally obligated to do so, or <code>false</code>, to indicate that
              it does not. For any other value the origin's support is unknown.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <code>lastUpdate</code> member. The value of the <code>lastUpdate</code>
              member MUST be an RFC3339 <code>full-date</code> (YYYY-MM-DD) or <code>date-time</code>
              (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ) [[RFC3339]]. This indicates the time at
              which the statement of support was made, such that later changes to the meaning of the
              GPC standard should not affect the interpretation of the resource for legal purposes.
              If the member is not in a valid RFC3339 format, the last update date and time is
              unknown.
            </li>

      <h2>Legal Effects</h2>
      <p class="change">
          This specification is agnostic as to the <i>legal effects</i> 
          of the GPC signal and intentionally does not restrict the
          interpretation of GPC under any specific law or jurisdiction.
          This specification only defines how the user and website, 
          as willing parties who act in conformance with this specification, 
          can utilise the GPC signal to communicate and implement the user's intent 
          to limit the selling or sharing of their personal data. 
          However, the use of GPC may create legal effects depending on its interpretation
          and implementation within specific jurisdictions. Examples of legal 
          effects are as an obligation to respect the GPC signal or as
          an implementation of specific user rights. 
          The determination of legal effects depends on contextual factors such as the user's location, jurisdiction of applicable laws, and existing 
          agreements between the user and the website. It is therefore 
          encouraged for respective jurisdictions and their authorities to 
          determine how GPC should be interpreted and enforced based on the 
          relevant laws.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Legal Interpretation</h3>
        <p class="change">
          Given the complexities of existing legal frameworks, websites who accept the GPC signal
          should disclose whether and how they implement the GPC signal in that jurisdiction. Websites should also disclose how they deal with
          conflicts between the signal and other specific privacy choices that the person has already
          made, including instances where third party sharing may be
          legally permitted such as sharing necessary for service provision, legal purposes or at the
          direction of the individual.
        </p>
        <p class="change">
          Following is an example of how U.S. State privacy laws codified the legal effects of using GPC.
          The development of GPC happened in tandem with new privacy laws in the United Sates (U.S.), especially those in California. Starting with the enactment of the <a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> in 2018, other U.S. states also
          passed privacy laws that give consumers the legal right to opt out of the sale or share of
          their data, or the use of their data for cross-organization targeted advertising. Many of those state
          laws make explicit provision for the exercise of those rights through universal opt-out mechanisms.
          At least four states have specifically identified GPC as a valid means to exercise
          legal opt-out rights. A minority of states provide for rulemaking procedures to allow regulators
          to expand on the specifics of how universal opt-out requests should be honored; whereas other states
          rely upon informal guidance or enforcement actions to provide clarity on the scope of legal
          obligations around GPC signals.

        <h2><span class="change">User Experience</h2>
        <p>
          This document does not specify what information must be presented to a user before activating
          GPC. When a user agent promotes a privacy feature or offers a privacy setting, it can make the
          determination if it is appropriate to send GPC based on what has been disclosed to the user.
          
          User agents SHOULD strive to represent what the user agent best believes to be the person's
          preference for the Global Privacy Control value. While studies have shown that most people do not
          want their data sold or shared <span class="change">or uded for targeted advertising</span>, 
          <span class="st">some jurisdictions have enacted "opt-out" legal frameworks
          where consumers have to take an affirmative action to express a [=preference=] to limit data
          sharing or the use of their data for targeted advertising.</span>
          <span class="change">requirements vary by jurisdiction for 
          whether users are required to express a [=preference=] to enable such
          sharing (opt-in) or to prevent it (opt-out).</span>
          GPC is designed to let users easily
          take advantage of these laws<span class="change">, for example
          by using the GPC signal as a [=preference=] that they do not want to
          opt-in, or to indicate that they wish to opt-out.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="change">
          Jurisdictions may have varying prerequisites before a website can enable signal like GPC. For example, some U.S. states require that a user agent may not send a universal opt-out signal by
          "default," though at least one state (California?) has said that selecting a privacy focused user agent is a
          sufficient indicator of user intent.
        </p>
        <p class="changed">
          Jurisdictions may also have specific requirements about informing
          users before a opt-in or opt-out is accepted. User agents are expected, where required, to present all the appropriate notices to people
          to ensure that the rights they wish to avail themselves of are effectively binding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different jurisdictions may also have different rules for when companies can override or disregard
          <span class="st">a universally applicable opt-out signal</span><span class="change">the GPC signal</span>,
          for example because they have consent from the user to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          The legal landscape around <span class="st">global opt-outs</span>
          <span class="change">privacy signals</span> is also changing. Several <span class="change">U.S.</span> states have now passed
          laws that include requirements to honor global opt-outs, <span class="change">as mentioned in the previous section,</span> though <span class="st">some of those states’</span> provisions
          differ considerably. <span class="st">Additionally states may revise their legal requirements as California has
          already amended the original CCPA that was passed in 2018.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="st">In addition to the United States<span class="st"><span class="change">Similar to the U.S. states</span>, other jurisdictions may recognize universal privacy signals
          and may impose their own requirements before such signals are deemed legally binding.
        </p>

      <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Exposing a user's preference (in the HTTP header field or {{Window/navigator}} object)
        potentially divides users into two groups in a way that might increase the information
        available for browser or device fingerprinting. This additional information is available 
        unless the signal perfectly correlates with other signals or is turned on in a 
        non-configurable setting. Thus, depending on the implementation, the GPC signal may impose 
        a privacy cost, though, one intended to be justified by the privacy benefit of sending the 
        signal.

      <h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        It is worth considering that a GPC signal will be attached to every HTTP request made to a
        given site. Rendering a page on the Web often requires making dozens such requests. As such
        it can prove impractical for GPC signals to trigger full-blown opt-out procedures with
        costly audit trails for every single GPC interaction as that will cause a large amount of
        processing, including for resources served from a content delivery network (CDN) that must
        be executed as efficiently as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regulations that intend to support GPC are encouraged to consider such implementation
        difficulties. One way of addressing them is to differentiate between user interface
        affordances given to people for the purpose of requesting a [=do-not-sell-or-share
        interaction=] [=preference=] to persist on the site, and the provision of a
        [=do-not-sell-or-share interaction=] signal the state of which is maintained with the
        user agent. In the latter case, the interaction can be processed as if the person had
        previously requested such a [=do-not-sell-or-share interaction=] [=preference=] and were
        interacting with that [=preference=] already active.
