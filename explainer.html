        [[[GPC]]] is a proposed specification designed to allow Internet users to notify businesses of their preference to not have their personal information sold or shared, or used for cross-context targeted advertising. It consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser that provides a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the specification.</p>
        <aside class="note" title="Informative Contents">
          <p>This Legal and Implementation Considerations Guide is designed to give an overview of how GPC operates as well as a summary of the legal effects GPC may have in different jurisdictions. However, this document is for informative purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>An increasing number of laws and regulatory environments require that
      sites respect people’s choices <span class="change">regarding how their
        personal data is or is not shared or sold to third parties, and </span>
        to not be tracked across different
      contexts. While these laws describe privacy choices in different ways it
      is clear that they represent an interest in giving people the capability
      to exercise a right to privacy and that people have an interest in
      exercising that right.</p>
      <p><span class="st">Some laws establish a requirement for a universal control that can
      present this opt out request at a user-agent level automatically, making
      it easier for people to exercise their rights without negotiating a
      site-level user interface.</span></p>
      <p class="change">Laws in specific jurisdictions vary in their requirements
        for how users can express their preferences, including whether this can
        be done through a universal control or signal, like [[GPC]], which 
        is automatically communicated by the user-agent, and which makes it easier
        for people to exercise their rights without negotiating a site-level
      user interface</p>
      <p>With this in mind the [[GPC]] specification proposes a way for
      user-agents to present people’s preferences <span class="st">to opt out</span>
      to sites via both
      a header and a JavaScript object. The specification intends to capture
      the standard ways sites currently <span class="st">handle opt out</span>
      <span class="change">privacy</span> choices.</p>
      <p>The motivation of GPC is to:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Make it easy for people to clearly and unambiguously present their
      privacy preference to a website and the various technologies it may
      run.</li>
      <li>Allow website developers to incorporate people’s privacy choices
      with as little delay and complexity as possible.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The [[GPC]] specification also provides an option for sites to provide a 'GPC
      Support Resource' that allows sites to state that they are aware of and
      support the GPC specification. <span class="change">Specific laws and their implementations may
      require that GPC be respected.</span>
      The goal of the GPC Support Resource is to allow
      sites to <span class="change">communicate that they respect GPC proactively</span>. 
      This demonstration is useful to
      regulators, lawyers, and activists in determining the impact of people’s
      privacy choices as well as sites’ awareness. It is also useful in giving
      people a clear signal that their privacy choices are respected to the
      best of a site’s ability.</p>
      <p class="change">Further to this document, it is also recommended to read the [[[privacy-principles]]], which is a W3C Statement (highest maturity of a W3C non-standard document). The GPC
        specification relies on several key concepts and principles described in this
        document, in particular regarding privacy, choices, and key concepts.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>GPC Signal &amp; Specification</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Technical Scope</h3>
        <p class="change">
          The [[[GPC]]] is a signal that is automatically communicated by the user-agent,
          for example as the web browser used by the user to visit website, or
          as part of the device or its apps through which the user accesses a service.
          Configuration of the GPC signal is not defined in the GPC specification, and is left to the user-agents (e.g. browsers, devices) as part of their existing relationships with 
        the user. This means, for example, that some browsers may choose to make GPC active by default, whereas others may opt to ask the user during the setup process or provide it as part of their settings.</p>
        <p class="change">
          A GPC signal can only be expressed in one form - it is either on and active,
          or it not communicated at all i.e. it is 'absent'. It is thus a 'unary signal'.
          A site can only ascertain that GPC is 'present' and thus is 'on' and active', or that it is 'absent'. A site should not interpret the absence of a GPC signal as an indication
          that it is 'off' or 'inactive' as this would be ambiguous from cases where the user
          is not using GPC or that the use of GPC is not supported by the user-agent.
        </p>
        <p class="change">
          When the GPC signal is present and being communicated, the [[GPC]] specification intentionally only allows one single and consistent value to be communicated from the user to the site. This single value represents the preference of the user for their "data not be sold to or shared with any party other than the one the person intends to interact with, or to have their data used for cross-context ad targeting" (as defined in the [[GPC]] specification). 
          The use of a GPC signal to indicate any other preference or information is not 
          supported. This means a website cannot use the GPC signal itself to communicate
          back with the user, and neither can the user use the GPC signal to indicate other
          preferences to the website.
          And as explained before, an absence of the GPC signal should not be taken to mean the opposite i.e. the user is somehow permitting their data to be sold or shared, or that the user is signalling a different preference than the one defined in the GPC specification.
          The GPC signal is thus a single directional communication mechanism that only allows users
          to express their preference to the websites and does not support anything else. This means other communication needs, whether from
          the user or from the websites, must be achieved through other existing means.
        </p>
        <p class="change">
          The [[GPC]] specification does not dictate how websites should behave
          when receiving the GPC signal. This means websites can choose whether to accept it without informing the users, or to confirm with the users before applying it, or to ignore it and then whether to inform the users. The [[GPC]] specification recommends,
          but does not require, websites to indicate whether they support the GPC signal through the
          'GPC Support Resource'. As noted in the specification, legal requirements may dictate
          how and where GPC should be supported, and whether websites are required to implement
          it in a specific manner. The goal of this document is to support implementors in 
          aligning the use of GPC with relevant laws, however, without providing any authorative
          legal advice or normative interpretations.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Opt-in vs Opt-out</h3>
        <p class="change">
          In understanding the legal effects of using a GPC signal, we can
          consider laws and legal frameworks, which vary greatly across jurisdictions,
          as having two broadly defined mechanisms. The first mechanism is
          through an <strong>opt-in</strong>,
          where the user agrees to a proposed use of their personal data i.e. before
          it has begun, and where it cannot initiate unless the user acts affirmatively. Opt-ins
          can also be implemented through <i>informed consent</i> where the user
          is provided with relevant information and then makes a decision on whether
          to accept or reject the proposal. Some jurisdictions may also define 
          rights regarding the ability of the user to give informed consent, as well as
          to revoke or withdraw an already given consent.
          The second mechanism is through an <strong>opt-out</strong>, where the
          personal data is already being used, and the user must agree to stop its use,
          i.e. the data use continues unless the user acts preventatively.
          As with consent, some jurisdictions may also define opt-outs as a right of the
        user. The [[Privacy-Principles]] document provides further guidance on these concepts.</p>
        <p class="change">
          While the two mechanisms of opt-in and opt-out are contradictory in 
          that they cannot be implemented simultaneously, legal frameworks can support
          both in different contexts. For example, specific uses of data may require
          an opt-in consent, whereas others may require an opt-out.
          In both cases, the user is required to communicate an intent or preference,
          which the GPC signal can support. For opt-ins, the GPC signal cannot 
          communicate that the user wants to opt-in or gives consent to enable
          the sharing or selling of personal data. Instead, the GPC signal
          can (only) communicate that the user does not want to share or sell their personal data, and which can be taken to mean that the user does not want to given consent for these.
          Similarly, for opt-outs, the GPC signal can (only) be taken to mean
          that the user wants to opt-out of sharing or selling their personal data.
          The GPC signal cannot be used to communicate that the user does not want to opt-out.
        </p>
        <p class="change">
          To summarise: the GPC signal can be used to indicate a preference that the user: 
        </p>
        <ol type="1" class="change">
          <li>Does not want to opt-in regarding the selling or sharing of their personal data to third parties or its use in cross-context targeted advertising; or </li>
          <li>Does want to opt-out regarding the selling or sharing of their personal data to third parties or its use in cross-context targeted advertising; or </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section class="change">
        <h3>First vs Third Party</h3>
        <p>
          The preference communicated through a GPC signal is not intended to affect 
          any use of personal data by the first party (e.g. website or service provider).
          This means a website or service receiving a GPC signal is not 
          required to change its own behaviour unless it is involves third parties
          or cross-context advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
          The notion of first and third parties is not strictly defined in the GPC specification itself. The [[Privacy-Principles]] document provides a web-focused explanation
          of first and third parties, and how they relate to the user and their interactions.
          In addition, specific legal frameworks may also define specific roles
          as first and third parties which may or may not be clear for actors on the web.
          As such, the implementation of the GPC signal's effects is dependant on
          the identification and categorisation of actors as first and third parties,
          and thus can vary across locations and contexts due to the changes in websites,
          users, and applicable jurisdictions.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="change">
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          The GPC specification defines the 'do-not-sell-or-share preference' with
          a limitation on data being used for 'cross-context ad targeting'. 
          The [[Privacy-Principles]] document defines context as "<i>a physical or digital 
            environment in which people interact with other actors, 
          and which the people understand as distinct from other contexts</i>".
          It is thus a subjective concept and it intended to provide flexibility
          to ascertain how the user's privacy should best be implemented within
          the context in which the GPC is being applied.
          The [[Privacy-Principles]] document further notes that "<i>A context is 
          not defined in terms of who owns or controls it</i>" and that "<i>Sharing
          data between different contexts of a single company can be a privacy violation, just as if the same data were shared between unrelated actors</i>".
          This further indicates that 'cross-context' has a strong focus on 
          privacy preservation and that the use of GPC is intended as an indication
          that the user wishes to apply this to their data.
        </section>
      </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Legal Effects of GPC</h2>
      <p class="change">
        As the GPC signal communicates a preference from the user regarding
        their personal data, this may trigger a legal effect based on the
        specifics of the situation. For example, if the jurisdiction has
        a law that dictates that privacy signals must be respected, then 
        the GPC may be considered binding. Similarly, if the jurisdiction
        has a law that dictates that user preferences must be taken into
        account when requesting a decision, then the use of
        GPC may lead to specific changes in the decision making process.
        The goal of this section is to provide a summary regarding the use 
        of GPC in three concrete contexts: first regarding laws that 
        specifically support the GPC; second regarding laws where the use of
        GPC may have relevant interpretations; and finally third where future
        laws could benefit from supporting the use of GPC. In all three cases,
        the GPC specification itself does not dictate how GPC should be 
        interpreted under the law. Instead, the guidance provided here is
        to assist relevant stakeholders (e.g. implementers, lawyers, law makers, users)
        to understand how the use of GPC could be supported through law, and to
        assist in relevant legal mechanisms implementing it.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Defined legal effects under existing laws</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="change">As of now, only four states in the U.S. have a defined legal effect
          regarding the use of GPC. These are California, Colorado, Connecticut, and New Jersey.</span>. Other states and jurisdictions who have relevant laws and mechanisms but lack an explicit and formal acknowledgement regarding GPC's legal effects are described in
          [[[#potential-legal-effects]]].
        </p>
        
        <section>
          <h4>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h4>
          <p>In 2018, California passed the first comprehensive privacy law in the
          United States. In addition to transparency obligations, the right to
          access personal information, and the right to delete personal
          information held by businesses, the CCPA gave California residents for
          the first time the legal right to opt out of the sale of their personal
          information. The CCPA included text that a consumer could appoint
          another entity to exercise their rights on their behalf. In January
          2021, the California Attorney General <a
          href="https://digiday.com/media/why-a-tweet-from-californias-ag-about-a-global-privacy-tool-has-companies-scrambling/">issued
          guidance</a> to businesses that sending GPC signals is to be interpreted
          as a legally binding exercise of opt-out rights under California law.
          Subsequently, the California Attorney General’s office updated its <a
          href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">Frequently Asked Questions
          page</a>, which in addition to other guidance, stated that GPC signals
          were legally binding invocation of opt-out rights under California
          law.</p>
          <p>Under the CCPA, the California Attorney General is empowered to issue
          regulations offering more clarity about specific portions of the text of
          the law. The <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa/reg">initial set
          of regulations</a> provided more clarity on how global opt-out signals
          should be interpreted as opt-out requests under the law. See § 999.315.
          Requests to Opt-Out (though note that these regulations have since been
          superceded — see following paragraphs).</p>
          <p>In November 2020, California voters approved an update to the CCPA
          under the California Privacy Rights Act ballot initiative. The
          initiative expanded the CCPA in a number of ways, including through the
          creation of a new privacy regulator (the California Privacy Protection
          Agency) and through <a href="https://thecpra.org/#1798.135(e)">increased
          specificity</a> on the legally binding nature of global privacy signals.
          Under the CPRA, the California Privacy Protection Agency was directed to
          expand on previously issued regulations.</p>
          <p>In March 2023, the Agency issued <a
          href="https://cppa.ca.gov/regulations/consumer_privacy_act.html">revised
          regulations</a>, including provisions on the operation of “opt-out
          preference signals.” See § 7025. Opt-out Preference Signals. The text
          includes detailed requirements around issues such as: the technical
          requirements for opt-out preference signals, when to apply browser-based
          opt-out preference signals to other consumer data, and when businesses
          can rely upon specific consent to disregard opt-out preference signals.
          The regulations includes illustrative examples on how the rules should
          work in practice.</p>
          <p>In August 2022, the California Attorney issued its <a
          href="%5Bhttps://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-announces-settlement-sephora-part-ongoing-enforcement">first
          enforcement action</a> under the CCPA, alleging that the makeup company
          Sephora adopted an unduly narrow definition of “sale” under the CCPA and
          failed to respond to GPC requests as legally valid opt-out requests. The
          company was required to pay a fine of $1.2 million and agree to
          substantial injunctive relief, including agreeing to treat GPC signals
          as requests to opt out of the sale of personal information.</p>
          <p><span class="change">[moved down]</span>
            GPC is not necessarily intended to invoke every <span class="st">new</span> privacy right in
          every jurisdiction. For example, GPC is not intended to globally invoke
          data deletion rights on every website people visit. GPC is also not
          intended to limit a first party’s use of personal information within the
          first-party context (such as a publisher targeting ads to an individual
          on its website based on that individual’s previous activity on that same
          site). For that reason, GPC should not be interpreted as exercising the
          CCPA’s right to limit the use of sensitive information in a first-party
          context.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Colorado Privacy Act</h4>
          <p>In July 2021, Colorado enacted the <a
          href="https://coag.gov/resources/colorado-privacy-act/">Colorado Privacy
          Act (CPA)</a>, which offered similar — though slightly different —
          protections as the California Consumer Privacy Act. One difference is
          that the CPA offers two different though related opt-out rights — the
          right to opt out of data sales and the right to opt out of cross-context
          targeted advertising.</p>
          <p>The text of the CPA explicitly provides for global privacy signals,
          stating “a consumer may authorize another person, acting on the
          consumer’s behalf, to opt out of the processing of the consumer’s
          personal data . . . including through a technology indicating the
          consumer’s intent to opt out such as a web link indicating a preference
          or browser setting, browser extension, or global device setting.” See §
          6-1-1306(a)(ii). The CPA then included a number of additional
          requirements of global privacy signals, including: the signal should not
          be sent by default but should reflect the user’s affirmative choice, it
          should be as consistent as possible with similar mechanisms in other
          states, and the user agent sending the signal should not “unfairly
          disadvantage” another data controller.</p>
          <p>The Colorado Privacy Act also directed the Colorado Attorney General
          to issue more detailed regulations, including specifically on the
          operation of global privacy signals. On March 2023, the Colorado
          Attorney General’s office published the initial <a
          href="https://coag.gov/app/uploads/2023/03/FINAL-CLEAN-2023.03.15-Official-CPA-Rules.pdf">regulations</a>
          implementing the privacy law, including greater specificity on the
          operation of universal opt-out mechanisms (see Part 5, Universal Opt-Out
          Mechanism). These regulations provide clarity on a number of issues,
          including restrictions on data use by companies receiving the signal.
          The regulations also clarify the rules on default settings, stating that
          general purpose, pre-installed browsers may not set universal opt-out
          signals by default, but if a product is marketed as exercising users’
          privacy choices, it may send an opt-out signal to controllers without
          additional consent from the user.</p>
          <p>The regulations also set up a “registry” of legally binding signals
          under the law to provide greater clarity to businesses as to which
          universal opt-out mechanisms must be treated as binding opt-out
          requests. In October 2023, the Colorado Attorney General’s office issued
          a call for proposals for signals that should be included in its
          registry. In February 2024, the office published the first <a
          href="https://coag.gov/uoom/">official registry</a> of legally binding
          universal opt-out mechanisms. The only signal recognized as legally
          binding was the Global Privacy Control.</p>

        <section>
          <h4>U.S. State Laws</h4>
          <p>Since 2018, at least nineteen U.S. states have passed comprehensive state privacy laws that include, among other rights, the right to opt out of
          the sale or sharing of personal information and/or the right to opt out
          of cross-context targeted advertising. Many of these laws explicitly
          state that consumers may exercise these rights through a universal
          signal, including a signal sent through a browser or operating system.
          At least four states have declared that receipt of a Global Privacy
          Control signal is to be interpreted as a legally binding exercise of the
          opt-out right in that state.</p>

          <p>
            <strong>States that explicitly provide for universal opt-out
        mechanisms</strong>
            In addition to California and Colorado, at least ten other states
          have passed comprehensive privacy legislation that explicitly provides
          for the operation of global privacy signals that must be treated as
          legally binding opt-outs under the law. Most of these state laws are
          broadly similar to the text of the Colorado Privacy Act, in that they
          apply to both sales and cross-context targeted advertising, and have
          similar provisions requiring, for example, that the signals reflect the
          intent of the user and that they not unfairly disadvantage other
          controllers.</p>
          <p>However, they also differ in a number of key ways. As one example,
          states like Texas and Nebraska provide that specific global opt-out
          signals will be deemed valid if they are legally recognized in another
          state jurisdiction. Most of these states do not provide for rulemaking
          from the Attorney General to issue more clarity on the operation of the
          global opt-out provisions, though regulators may offer more informal
          guidance through FAQs (as California originally did) or may bring
          enforcement actions to clarify the boundaries of the law.</p>

          States that have privacy law that is silent on universal opt-out
          mechanisms</strong>
          Some U.S. states have passed comprehensive privacy laws that make no
          mention of universal opt-out mechanisms. It is not clear what legal
          effect — if any — global mechanisms like GPC would have in such states.
          Because those state laws give significant discretion to companies in how
          opt-out rights are offered to consumers, it may well be the case that
          universal opt-out signals would have no effect under those laws.
          However, the ultimate interpretation of those laws lies with local
          enforcement agencies and the courts.</p>

          <h4>EU/EEA and GDPR</h4>
          <p>The European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) 
            enforce the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
            The GDPR is a horizontal regulation that governs all processing
            (Article 4-2, e.g. collect, store, use, share, erase) 
            of personal data (Article 4-1), and requires
            that all processing be justified through at least one 'legal basis' (Article 6),
            such as informed consent, contracts, or "legitimate interests".
            The GDPR also provides individuals (called 'data subjects', Article 4-1) with
            specific rights which include transparency before any processing takes place
            where the data subject must be provided information regarding what data is being processed, why, by whom, etc. (Article 12-14), the right to withdraw their
            given consent (Article 7-3), and to object to the use of legitimate interests (Article 21). 
          </p>
          <p>
            As explained earlier in [[[#gpc-signal-specification]]], the GPC signal can
            indicate preferences regarding refusing to opt-in and asking to opt-out. In the context of the GDPR, opt-ins can be treated as analogous to giving informed consent (Article 6-1a), and opt-out can be analogous to withdrawing given consent (Article 7-3) and objecting to legitimate interests (Article 6-1f). In this, it is important to note that
            the GDPR Article 6-1f specifically distinguishes between legitimate interests of
            the 'data controller' (which may be the same as first party in GPC) and those of 'third parties' (which may be the same as third parties in GPC). 
            Of these, the GDPR only explicitly acknowledges the objection to
            legitimate interests to be made "<i>by automated means using technical specifications</i>", which includes signals like GPC.
            Other uses of signals, though not explicitly permitted in the GDPR, are 
            also not prohibited.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the EU's legal framework, it is unusual for laws such as the GDPR
            to explicitly refer to a specific technical specification and to dictate
            that it is binding. Instead, the EU legal framework relies on several mechanisms
          through which signals could become legally enforceable. These include:</p>
          <ol type="i">
            <li><i>harmonised standards</i>: Standards explicitly dictated by law and developed by one of the recognised EU standardisation bodies. For GPC, the harmonised standard would state the effects of GPC and be published by a body such as CEN or ETSI.</li>
            <li><i>de-facto standards</i>: Technologies widely adopted such that it becomes part of common expectations to consider them as being supported. This could happen if GPC were to be standardised and is implemented by all major browsers or websites.</li>
            <li><i>authoritative adoption</i>: A law gives an authority or body the power to dictate whether a technical specification should be binding. In the case of GDPR, it does not explicitly provide such powers to authorities.</li>
            <li><i>court interpretation</i>: A court confirms that a privacy signal is legally relevant. This can be seen from a recent case law where the use of DNT signal was confirmed as being relevant by a German court (<a href="https://www.vzbv.de/en/court-prohibits-linkedins-data-privacy-infringements">case 16 O 420/19, District Court Berlin</a>).
          </ol>
          <p>GDPR authorities cannot unilaterally make a signal like GPC legally binding without relevant support from the law. Article 21-5 explicitly provides for automated means such as GPC to be used to object to legitimate interests, which could be confirmed by GDPR authorities or courts. A similar use of the GPC signal regarding refusal or withdrawal of consent does not have a similar explicit support. However, as noted above, if a technology becomes widely adopted, then it may be considered as binding by the authorities as part of the 'data protection by design and default' requirements of the GDPR (Article 25) which require the adoption of technical measures such as data minimisation. The GDPR authorities can however recommend that GPC be used as part of their guidance and campaigns in order to speed up the process. </p>
          <p>
            A GPC signal, in the context of the GDPR, can be interpreted based on the
            context of the situation. Since the GPC only acts regarding data being
            shared or sold with third parties or being used for cross-context ad targeting, 
            it could be considered relevant
            only for those consent or legitimate interests where these categories
            of processing are involved. 
            More specifically, the GPC's communication of a user's preference can be 
            considered as "<i>an indication of the data subject's wishes</i>" (Article 4-11),
            and it would then up to the data controller to consider how best to implement these.
            If the processing were to take place using consent, this could indicate
            that the data subject does not wish to consent. Similarly, if it were taking
            place using legitimate interests, it could mean the data subject wishes
            to object to them.

          <h4>Mauritius Data Protection Act</h4>
          <p>Mauritius, an African country, has the Data Protection Act (DPA). The
          DPA was inspired by the GDPR. The law provides for a number of bases for
          data processing, including consent and the “legitimate interest” of the
          data controller. For processing pursuant to a company’s “legitimate
          interest,” Article 24 of the DPA offers people an ability to opt out of
          such processing. As GPC is intended to convey a general request that
          data controllers limit the sale or sharing of the person’s personal data
          to other data controllers, Mauritian regulators may deem GPC to
          constitute a legally binding invocation of Article 24 rights. That would
          be the case if people’s GPC opt out preferences are their only known opt
          out preferences or their GPC opt out preferences are in line with any
          other opt out preferences they invoked. However, in case of conflicts
          there might be ambiguities as there is no explicit mention of global
          opt-out mechanism winning over a direct consent to a specific sharing
          request on a specific site.</p>

          The majority of U.S. states have not enacted comprehensive privacy
          legislation, and federally there is no privacy statute specifically
          covering commercial information. The Federal Trade Commission and state
          Attorneys General have enforced general purpose consumer protection law
          that prohibits unfair or deceptive practices against certain privacy
          behaviors, though none have made a specific claim about how GPC
          intersects with those laws. The FTC has proposed to issue regulations
          under its consumer protection statute governing “surveillance
          capitalism,” and <a

          <h4>EU Laws</h4>

            One of the proposed mechanisms (Article 88b) introduced is the use of technical 
            specifications to automate consent. If accepted, the proposal
            will require an EU standardisation body (such as CEN or ETSI) to
            develop a 'harmonised standard' which would be considered legally binding.
            While the proposal requires the mechanism to support both giving and
            refusing/withdrawing consent, it could also be used to justify GPC
            as a binding mechanism for the refusing/withdrawing of consent and the
            objection to legitimate interests.

      <h2 id="user-experience-considerations-and-recommendations">5. User
      Experience Considerations and Recommendations</h2>
      <p>It is not considered standard for W3C specifications to present user
      interface recommendations or restrictions. User interfaces are the
      domain of user-agents who, being closest to the user, best understand
      how their users interpret and react to the underlying functionality. For
      GPC, some user-agents may present themselves as privacy-focused
      technology, in which case it may make sense for the signal to be
      defaulted to on, which, for example, is supported in California and
      Colorado for privacy-focused technology. Some user-agents may be
      generic, with no expectation for people setting defaults. Some
      user-agents may present GPC in different formats and devices and
      necessitate unique user interface requirements.</p>
      <p>This Guide presents examples of user-agent user interfaces for GPC as
      an aid to adopters who are interested in or required to implement GPC as
      to how it can be presented.</p>
      <h3 id="example-presentations-of-user-agent-level-ui">5.1 Example
      Presentations of User-agent Level UI</h3>
      <p>The following examples come from the <a
      href="https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-optmeowt">OptMeowt browser
      extension</a>, which is developed at the <a
      href="https://privacytechlab.org/">privacy-tech-lab</a> at Wesleyan
      University. We also show how Mozilla surfaces the GPC setting in
      Firefox. These examples are shown to illustrate. They are not meant as a
      comprehensive set of UIs for GPC.</p>
      <p>Whichever user interface applications are implemented, they are
      expected to meet accessibility standards.</p>
      <p>User interfaces are further expected to have a clear visible switch
      for turning on the GPC signal that can clearly distinguish between
      active and inactive. <strong>For GPC “active” always means an individual
      is exercising their choice to opt out of sharing and cross-site usage to
      the extent provided by the law.</strong></p>

      The OptMeowt popup showing GPC details of the current site.</p>
      <p>User-agents may choose to allow people to manage the GPC signal for
      individual domains. The Individual domains can be represented to the
      user as a list that clearly indicates their settings. In such a list
      people may be able to add individual domains, domains may be
      automatically added, and people may manage domains on which they have
      already made an active choice, or exclude domains from the GPC opt out
      signal being active. When people choose a GPC setting for a site, it is
      expected that the user-agent retain that setting until they make an
      active choice to change it.</p>

      alt="OptMeowt Domain List" /> The OptMeowt domain list for setting GPC
      on individual sites.</p>
      <p>It is expected that most people will choose if they want to
      universally activate GPC across all domains and requests. Interfaces
      should reflect GPC’s intent to be as straightforward and simple as
      possible. People may also choose to disable GPC universally for their
      user-agent.</p>

      <p>A user interface can show what response is at
      <code>https://{yourwebsite.com}/.well-known/gpc.json</code> and display
      that information to the users so they can understand what claims the
      website is making in terms of GPC compliance. This can be done
      regardless of the properties included on the JSON document, the main
      concern is the value of the <code>gpc</code> property, as seen here.</p>

      <h3 id="user-agents">5.2 User-agents</h3>
      <p>The above examples are from an extension in a web browser.
      User-agents should implement similar interface conventions. The authors
      of this document recommend that user-gents have some way to display to
      people the state of their GPC signal when it is on during the course of
      regular interaction with the site instead of putting it behind a
      settings page.</p>
      <p>A setting should be included to manage GPC. At the very least a
      simple Boolean-value switch should be available to the user within
      settings to manage GPC universally for the user-agent.</p>
      <p>If GPC is not turned on by default, there should be a control that is
      accessible to people to turn it on when interacting with an individual
      site.</p>
      <p>If the user-agent makes the GPC setting visible when active, it
      should retain individuals’ privacy choices when they turn off GPC for a
      specific site.</p>
      <p>User-agents should not challenge people with a request to set GPC in
      either mode beyond initial setup. Per-domain settings of GPC should be
      up to an individual to engage with, not pushed via a notification,
      modal, pop-up, or similar interactive element.</p>
      <p>Many user-agents offer a “private browsing” or “incognito” mode that
      provides heightened privacy protections when in use, such as not
      retaining local history or cookies at the end of a session. Depending
      upon how that private mode is described to users, the developers of the
      user-agent may deem it appropriate to send GPC to websites while this
      mode is activated as a means of offering additional privacy protection.
      While browser developers make decide that additional consent or user
      prompting is unnecessary before sending GPC in such cases, they should
      be transparent about the fact that in “private” or “incognito” mode, GPC
      will be sent.</p>
      <h3 id="adopting-on-your-website">5.3 Adopting on Your Website</h3>
      <p>Given the complexities of existing privacy choice and consent
      frameworks, sites that implement GPC should disclose how they treat it
      in any jurisdiction for which they adopt it and how they deal with
      conflicts between a GPC signal and other specific privacy choices that
      an individual has already made directly with the site, including
      instances where third party sharing may be permitted, such as sharing to
      service providers/processors or at the direction of the individual.</p>
      <p>Where industry standards set specific strings or signals that are
      needed to communicate people’s privacy choices, sites should anticipate
      translating GPC into the downstream signal. A good example of such
      setting is handling GPC to set California-based US Privacy Strings for
      advertising technology:</p>

      <p>Setting the USPAPI for propagating GPC downstream.</p>
      <p>Generally website developers should consider GPC signals to be
      identical to a user flipping the opt out switch on their website and
      take action accordingly.</p>
      <h3 id="consent-to-disregard-a-universal-gpc-signal">5.4 Consent to
      Disregard a Universal GPC Signal</h3>
      <p>A do-not-sell-or-share preference is when a person generally requests
      of all website publishers that their data “not be sold or shared.”
      However, it is possible that a particular publisher would seek to enter
      into a separate agreement with a user permitting that publisher to sell
      or share the user’s data notwithstanding the general preference. The GPC
      spec does not provide for a mechanism or syntax to negotiate or indicate
      such an exception, so any user consent to tracking would be communicated
      apart from the GPC signal.</p>
      <p>When and how a separate agreement to disregard GPC requests overrides
      the legal status of the signal will be a matter of local law. Some
      jurisdictions that have explicitly endorsed GPC as a legally binding
      opt-out signal have also placed limitations on how companies can request
      permission to track despite the general signal. One rationale for such
      limitations is that without some restrictions, users with GPC enabled
      could be inundated with countless requests for exceptions to track as
      they browse the internet — undermining the fundamental purpose of
      offering a simple, binary universal opt-out tool. Both California and
      Colorado, for example, constrain how overrides for universal opt-out
      signals like GPC can be requested, including rules against retaliating
      against users for exercising privacy rights, conditions for valid
      consent, and limiting how frequently companies can ask consumers to
      reconsider opt-out requests.</p>
      <h2 id="alternatives-considered">6. Alternatives Considered</h2>
      <p>The authors of GPC considered other options for how the signal would
      work. The current state of privacy controls across the world is varied.
      The authors have experience both working on and implementing these more
      complex controls and found that people generally consider them to be
      unnecessarily complex. If people intend to make privacy choices, they
      almost always intend to exercise their rights broadly, e.g., opting out
      from all sites they visit, no matter how many individual controls exist.
      More recent laws have also adopted this understanding and moved towards
      requiring universal or significantly fewer degrees of control. GPC
      reflects this understanding of people’s privacy choices and, therefore,
      works in support of these laws.</p>
      <p>The signal has been through a few iterations with the specification
      before it was submitted to the W3C. More complex signals, more extensive
      data, and different delivery formats were all considered. Additional
      complexity in the signal creates fingerprinting risk. Delivering the
      signal for JavaScript-based consumers via a promise was considered as a
      more privacy-preserving option that would allow greater complexity but
      was rejected to prefer performance and simplicity.</p>
      <p>Removal of the GPC Support Resource was considered as well as further
      simplification of the contents. However, the maintenance of both the GPC
      Support Resource as an indicator of compliance and the presentation of
      the date were both reinforced during consultation with lawyers as
      extremely useful for maintaining documented compliance and dealing with
      potential legal activity, especially in cases of specification
      updates.</p>
